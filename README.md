# TIME-TABLE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Time Table Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the scheduling process in educational institutions. It supports three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student, each with dedicated login and registration interfaces. The Admin is responsible for generating and updating timetables based on input from teachers. Teachers can submit timetable change requests to the Admin, while Students have read-only access to view their class schedules. All users have the ability to view and print the timetable. This system minimizes scheduling conflicts, reduces manual effort, and enhances overall efficiency in timetable management.
